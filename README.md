# Drug Interaction Checker

This command-line application checks for potential drug interactions. It evaluates combinations of drugs entered by the user against a predefined list of interactions and outputs the most severe interaction detected.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: The application runs on Node.js. If it's not installed on your system, download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup and Execution

### Step 1: Preparation
Ensure the `interactions.js` file is in the same directory. The `.json` file contains the drug interaction data required by the script.

### Step 2: Running the Application
1. Open a command line interface (CLI).
2. Navigate to the directory containing your files.
3. Execute the script with Node.js:
   ```bash
